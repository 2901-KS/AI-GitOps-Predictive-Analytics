##AI-Powered Automated Network Software Deployment
(Predictive Analytics Prototype – Milestone 1)
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the PRISM worklet “AI-Powered Automated Network Software Deployment Solution Using Cloud-Native Practices”.
The objective is to enhance GitOps-based deployment workflows using AI-driven predictive analytics to proactively identify risky deployments.

👉 Current implementation focuses on Milestone-1, which validates the feasibility of AI-based deployment risk prediction.

🎯 Milestone-1 Objective

As defined in the worklet roadmap, Milestone-1 focuses on:

AI/ML model selection

AI model training

Predictive analytics prototype integration

Conceptual extension of GitOps decision logic

⚠️ Kubernetes integration and self-healing mechanisms are planned for later milestones.

🧠 What Has Been Implemented (Till Now)
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Real telecom deployment logs were not available due to security constraints.

Realistic synthetic deployment logs were generated to simulate deployment behavior.

Each record represents a deployment attempt with the following features:

CPU usage

Memory usage

Latency

Restart count

Error rate

2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Raw deployment metrics were preprocessed and standardized.

Feature engineering pipeline converts raw logs into ML-ready numerical features.

Processed data is stored in data/processed/.

3️⃣ AI Model Training

A Logistic Regression model was trained for binary classification:

Deployment Success vs Deployment Failure

The model achieves approximately 86% accuracy on synthetic deployment data.

Logistic Regression was chosen intentionally for:

Interpretability

Stability on limited data

Fast inference suitable for deployment pipelines

4️⃣ Explainability

Feature importance was extracted from the trained model.

Key contributors to deployment risk:

Error rate

CPU usage

Memory usage

Explainability enables transparency in deployment decisions.

5️⃣ Deployment Risk Prediction

The trained model predicts:

Failure probability

Deployment risk level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

Based on risk level, recommended deployment actions are generated:

LOW → Safe to deploy

MEDIUM → Deploy with monitoring

HIGH → Block deployment and alert DevOps

This demonstrates AI-assisted decision support for GitOps workflows.

🔁 Conceptual GitOps Extension

While GitOps infrastructure is not yet implemented, the following conceptual extension is demonstrated:

Deployment Metrics → AI Risk Prediction → Decision Logic → GitOps Action


The AI model acts as a decision intelligence layer that can guide GitOps pipelines in future milestones.
